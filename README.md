## Overview

Success in data science and statistics is dependent on the development
of both analytical and computational skills. As statistics educators we
are more familiar and comfortable with teaching the former, but the
latter is becoming increasingly important. The goal of this workshop is
to equip educators with concrete information on content and
infrastructure for painlessly introducing modern computation into a data
science and/or statistics curriculum. In addition to gaining technical
knowledge, participants will engage in discussion around the decisions
that go into choosing infrastructure and developing curriculum. Workshop
attendees will work through several exercises from existing courses and
get first-hand experience with using relevant tool-chains and
techniques, including R/RStudio, literate programming with R Markdown,
and collaboration, version control, and automated feedback with
Git/GitHub. We will also discuss best practices for configuring and
deploying classroom infrastructures to support these tools. This
workshop is aimed at participants who are interested in the role of
computing in either a Statistics or Data Science curriculum, including
faculty designing new courses/programs and those interested in adding or
improving a computational component to an existing course. A basic
knowledge of R is assumed and familiarity with Git is preferred.

## Learning objectives

1.  Understand the differences between various computing infrastructures
    for teaching data science and set up a classroom infrastructure
    using RStudio Cloud.
2.  Adopt or design an introductory data science curriculum using R as
    the programming language and tidyverse packages as the grammar of
    choice.
3.  Implement reproducible data analysis assignments and assessments
    that leverage R Markdown and Git as well as course management via
    GitHub.
4.  Gain skills and confidence for teaching data science and
    computational statistics with a modern toolkit.

## Instructor

[Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](http://mine-cr.com) is Senior Lecturer in the
School of Mathematics at University of Edinburgh and Data Scientist and
Professional Educator at RStudio. She is on leave from her Associate
Professor of the Practice position at the Department of Statistical
Science at Duke University. Mine’s work focuses on innovation in
statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing,
reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source
education as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing retention of
women and under-represented minorities in STEM. Mine works on
integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum,
using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and
complex datasets. She also organizes ASA DataFest, an annual two-day
competition in which teams of undergraduate students work to reveal
insights into a rich and complex data set. Mine works on the OpenIntro
project, whose mission is to make educational products that are free,
transparent, and lower barriers to education. As part of this project
she co-authored three open-source introductory statistics textbooks. She
is also the creator and maintainer of datasciencbox.org and she teaches
the popular Statistics with R MOOC on Coursera.

Mine is the Chair of the ASA’s Section on Statistics and Data Science
Education. In 2018 Mine received the David Pickard Teaching Award and in
2016 the ASA Waller Education Award. She is also the recipient of the
2015 JSM Best Paper Award in the Section on Teaching Statistics in the
Health Sciences and the 2014 Duke University David and Janet Vaughan
Brooks Award for Teaching Excellence.
